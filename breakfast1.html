    					<ul>
    						<li>1 whole wheat English muffin, sliced in half and toasted</li>
                            <li>2 teaspoons mayonnaise</li>
                            <li>1/2 ripe avocado, mashed</li>
                            <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
                            <li>1 large egg</li>
                            <li>1/2 teaspoon water</li>
                            <li>1 teaspoon butter or olive oil</li>
                            <li>1 slice of ripe red tomato</li>
                            <li>Thinly sliced red onion</li>
                            <li>Several dashes of hot sauce</li>
                            <li>Small handful argula or sprouts</li>
    					</ul>
    				</div>
    				<div id="instructions">
    					<ol>
    						<li>To prepare your sandwiches, spread the mayonnaise over the lower half of your toasted muffin. Spread the mashed avocado over the other half, and sprinkle it with a few dashes of salt and pepper.
                            </li>
                            <li>Heat a medium non-stick skillet or well-seasoned cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. In a bowl, scramble the egg with the water and a few dashes of salt and pepper.
                            </li>
                            <li>Once the skillet is hot, add a pat of butter and swirl the pan to coat the bottom. Pour in the scrambled egg and immediately swirl the egg in the bottom of the pan to make an even layer.
                            </li>
                            <li>Once the egg is set enough to fold over onto itself with a spatula (this could take 30 seconds to 1 minute), fold one side over the middle, then the opposite side over the middle. Repeat with the other two sides so you have a cute little egg envelope. Let it cook for another 15 to 30 seconds, until it’s set enough that you can transfer it to a plate.</li>
                            <li>Place the cooked egg on the mayo-covered bun. Top with a slice of tomato, if using. Add with several slices of red onion, a few dashes of hot sauce, and a little handful of arugula. Top it with the remaining bun, avocado side down.</li>
                            <li>To slice it in half, insert a sharp knife into the center of the sandwich, and slice across to one edge. Repeat in the opposite direction. Serve warm! If you’re making more sandwiches, reduce the stove temperature from medium-high to medium, as the pan only gets hotter the longer it’s on the stove.</li>
